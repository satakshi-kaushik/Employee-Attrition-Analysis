# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (attrition) based on various features such as job role, satisfaction level, salary, work-life balance, and more.

## Problem Statement

Employee attrition is a significant concern for organizations as it leads to increased costs in hiring, onboarding, and lost productivity. By predicting attrition, HR departments can take proactive measures to retain valuable employees.

## Objective

To develop a predictive model that classifies employees into two categories:
- **Yes/1** (Likely to leave)
- **No/0** (Likely to stay)

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **VS Code**

## Dataset

- The dataset contains various attributes such as:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Department
  - Monthly Income
  - Job Role
  - Job Satisfaction
  - OverTime
  - Years at Company
  - Attrition (target)

> Note: The dataset taken from Kaggle.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized distributions of key features
- Analyzed correlations between features and attrition
- Identified patterns (e.g., employees working overtime or with low job satisfaction are more likely to leave)

## Model Building

- Applied classification model:
  - Logistic Regression

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score

## âœ… Conclusion

- The model successfully predicts employee attrition with good accuracy.
- Helps organizations in identifying at-risk employees early.
- The dashboard supports HR teams with visual insights for decision-making.
